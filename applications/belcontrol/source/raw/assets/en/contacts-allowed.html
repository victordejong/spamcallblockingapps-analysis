<h4>Allowed Callers</h4>
<div>You can add callers to your Allowed Callers list to ensure they are never blocked by Call Control.</div>
<div>There are times when our community blocking feature may block a call youâ€™d like to receive. Simply add those callers here to receive these calls in the future.</div>
<div>All of your contacts are automatically allowed to call and are never blocked by default, so no need to add them here.</div>
